[![Build Status](https://github.com/TonyKennah/worldom/actions/workflows/python-package-conda.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TonyKennah/worldom/actions/workflows/python-package-conda.yml)

A 2D strategy game prototype created with Python and Pygame, featuring procedural world generation and tile-based unit movement.

## Features

*   **Procedural World Generation:** Creates unique, seamlessly tileable worlds using 4D Perlin noise. This ensures that the wrap-around map has no visible seams, creating a truly continuous world.
*   **Dynamic Camera:** A fully featured camera with stepped zooming (centered on the cursor) and smooth panning (using WASD keys and edge scrolling).
*   **Interactive Tile Map:** An efficient, tile-based map that only renders visible tiles and displays a grid at appropriate zoom levels.
*   **A\* Pathfinding:** Intelligent, natural-looking unit movement that navigates around obstacles. The pathfinding has been tuned to feel less "robotic" by introducing a small random cost to each step.
*   **UI Panel:** An on-screen UI panel displays key information like FPS, zoom level, and cursor coordinates, and includes a clickable Exit link.
*   **Unit Control:** Select single units with a left-click or multiple units by dragging a selection box with the left mouse button. Command selected units via a right-click context menu. The "Build" command opens a sub-menu with structure options.

## Tech Stack

*   **Language:** Python 3
*   **Core Library:** [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news)
*   **Map Generation:** `opensimplex` library for seamless Perlin/Simplex noise

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Set up the project:**
    If you have cloned this via git, you can skip this step. Otherwise, ensure all files are in the `worldom` directory as structured below.

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the game:**
    The main entry point is `main.py`. Run it from the root directory:
    ```bash
    python main.py
