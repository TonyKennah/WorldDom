The project follows standard Python conventions (PEP 8). It uses type hints for function signatures and class attributes. Docstrings are used to explain the purpose of modules, classes, and functions. The code is organized into classes and methods, with a clear separation of concerns between different components (e.g., `Game`, `Camera`, `Map`, `Unit`). The project uses a `src` layout to separate source code from other files.
