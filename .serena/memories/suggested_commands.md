- **Run the game:** `python main.py`
- **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Linting:** `pylint --extension-pkg-allow-list=pygame $(git ls-files '*.py')` (Note: This command is from the GitHub Actions workflow and might need to be adapted for local use, especially on Windows, e.g., by replacing `$(git ls-files '*.py')` with a list of Python files).
